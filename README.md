# Hadoop---Flight-Arrival-data-analysis


Airline on-time performance in United States of America. Make a smart choice while booking your flight.

## Summary

Taking an airplane is one of the most important and efficient ways to travel. However, many travelers have experienced delayed flight. Which airline carriers delayed most often? Which airports have highest probability to make you wait for a long time? Also, which day of week and which month of year are better for your journey without severe delay?

The aim of this project is to produce a graphical summary of the airline performance data.

Due to the large size of the data set, the author retrieved the recent 11 yearsâ€™ (1998-2008) data for analysis.

All the analyses are made from four different aspects:
* Best airlines to avoid delays.
* Top 25 Airports severely delayed.
* Best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimize delays.
* And Cancellation counts on reasons, monthly basis and airlines.
* Recommendations in terms of the aspects above are made at the end.
